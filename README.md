# MNIST-digit-classifier
This repository contains an implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a well-known benchmark for image classification tasks, containing 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits (0-9).

## Features
* Deep Learning Framework: Built using TensorFlow/Keras (or PyTorch, specify based on your implementation).
* Model Architecture: Implements a robust CNN architecture optimized for image classification tasks.
* Training and Evaluation: Scripts to train the model from scratch and evaluate its performance on the test dataset.
* Visualization: Tools to visualize training progress, model performance, and sample predictions.
