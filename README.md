# MNIST-digit-classifier
This repository contains an implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a well-known benchmark for image classification tasks, containing 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits (0-9).
